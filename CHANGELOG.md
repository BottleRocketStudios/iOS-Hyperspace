## High Level Changes

* Changed underlying error in AnyError's NetworkServiceFailureInitializable implementation from NetworkServiceError to NetworkServiceFailure so it can return its failure response rather than nil.
[Richard Burgess](https://github.com/rickbdotcom)
[#95](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/95)

* Finished migrating all targets to Swift 5.
[Tyler Milner](https://github.com/tylermilner)
[#100](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/100)

* Migrate the request recovery strategy to the BackendServiceProtocol definition.
[Will McGinty](https://github.com/wmcginty)
[#110](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/110)

* Rename `RequestRecoveryStrategy` to `RecoveryStrategy` and allow multiple to be attached to a single `BackendService`. They are executed in the order they are initialized.
[Will McGinty](https://github.com/wmcginty)
[#117](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/117)

* Rename `DecodingFailureInitializable` to `DecodingFailureRepresentable` and make the failing `HTTP.Response` available during initialization.
[Will McGinty](https://github.com/wmcginty)
[#117](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/117)

* Create an `HTTP.Body` type to abstract the `Data` of a `URLRequest`.
[Will McGinty](https://github.com/wmcginty)
[#117](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/117)

## 3.0.0 (2019-01-03)

##### Enhancements

* Fixed CHANGELOG for version 2.0.0/2.1.0.
  [Tyler Milner](https://github.com/tylermilner)
  [#73](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/73)

* Remove the type definitions deprecated in 2.0.0
  [Will McGinty](https://github.com/wmcginty)
  [#72](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/72)

* **[BREAKING]** Added failing type information to `DecodingFailureInitializable` allowing the API to make decisions based off of the type that failed to decode and deprecate dynamically keyed decoding.
  [Will McGinty](https://github.com/wmcginty)
  [#71](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/71)

* **[BREAKING]** Renamed `Request` protocol's `transformData(_:serviceSuccess:)` method to `transformSuccess(_:)`. The redundant `data` parameter was removed since the `NetworkServiceSuccess` makes it available as a property. Also simplified method signatures by introducing `RequestTransformBlock` typealias.
  [Tyler Milner](https://github.com/tylermilner)
  [#69](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/issues/69)
  [#70](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/70)

* Updated Travis-CI to Xcode 9.4.
  [Tyler Milner](https://github.com/tylermilner)
  [#63](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/63)

* Add `headers` property to `HTTP.Response`. The method signature of `Request`â€™s `transformData(_:)` method has changed. If you implement a custom `transformData(_:)` method, you will need to replace it with `transformData(_:serviceSuccess:)`.
  [Earl Gaspard](https://github.com/earlgaspard)
  [#64](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/64)

* Updated Result dependency to version 4.0, updated Travis-CI to Xcode 10, and updated Swift version from Swift 4.1 to Swift 4.2 (for both library and sample app).
  [Tyler Milner](https://github.com/tylermilner)
  [#67](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/67)

##### Bug Fixes

* None.


## 2.0.0 (2018-08-03)

##### Enhancements

* Two new error-facing protocols were added. `NetworkServiceFailureInitializable` represents a `Swift.Error` that can be initialized from a `NetworkServiceFailure` object. `DecodingFailureInitializable` represents a `Swift.Error` that can be initialized from a `DecodingError` as a result of decoding `Data`. These conformances have been added as extensions to `AnyError` (meaning `AnyRequest` usage is unaffected). As a result of these new protocols, the `BackendServiceError` type has been removed. Types conforming to `Request` now have an associated `ErrorType` which must conform to `NetworkServiceFailureInitializable`. If a request generates any sort of failure response, the custom error type will be initialized from it instead of returning a generic `BackendServiceError`. In addition, if `Request.ErrorType` conforms to `DecodingFailureInitializable`, the custom error type will be instantiated and returned.
    [Will McGinty](https://github.com/wmcginty)
    [#38](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/38)

* Added a new initalizer to `AnyRequest` which accepts a `String` value designating the key of JSON at which to begin decoding.
    [Will McGinty](https://github.com/wmcginty)
    [#41](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/41)

* Separated the generation/encoding of the URL query from the `Request` object into an extension `URL`.
    [Will McGinty](https://github.com/wmcginty)
    [#40](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/40)

* Add functionality to `NetworkReqest` to allow for replacing and adding to the HTTP headers.
    [Will McGinty](https://github.com/wmcginty)
    [#43](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/43)

* Simplify usage of `DecodableContainer` types with `JSONDecoder`
    [Will McGinty](https://github.com/wmcginty)
    [#44](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/44)

* Add a subsystem which can perform transparent error handling using `RequestRecoveryStrategy`.
    [Will McGinty](https://github.com/wmcginty)
    [#45](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/45)

* Simplify usage of `dataTransfomer` extensions with custom error types
    [Will McGinty](https://github.com/wmcginty)
    [#47](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/47)

* Add `HTTP.HeaderValue` for JSON API specification.
    [Earl Gaspard](https://github.com/earlgaspard)
    [#46](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/46)

* Converted `HTTP.Status`nested types (`HTTP.Status.Success`, `HTTP.Status.ClientError`, etc.) from enums to `RawRepresentable` structs. This keeps the library more open for extension by allowing clients to more easily specify and use custom HTTP status codes.
    [Tyler Milner](https://github.com/tylermilner)
    [#49](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/49)
    [#50](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/50)

* Implemented synthesized `Equatable` and `Hashable` conformance that was introduced in Swift 4.1.
    [Tyler Milner](https://github.com/tylermilner)
    [#51](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/51)

* Renamed `NetworkRequest` and `AnyNetworkRequest` to `Request` and `AnyRequest`.
    [Will McGinty](https://github.com/wmcginty)
    [#52](https://github.com/BottleRocketStudios/iOS-Hyperspace/pull/52)

##### Bug Fixes
